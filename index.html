        Hello, my name is Parker Miller. I am originally from Kansas City,
        but now go to school at the University of Nebraska - Lincoln in the Raikes School of Computer Science and
        Business Management. The Raikes school is a highly selective and prestigious school within the honors program at
        the University of Nebraska. The main focus of the Raikes program is the interdisciplinary combination of
        computer science, business, and teamwork. Within this school and previous internships I have picked up skills in
        Java, C#,
        C, C++, JavaScript, Python, R, SQL, HTML, CSS, and React.js.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of academics I love playing sports with my friends (specifically lacrosse). I also enjoy playing video
        games and binge
        watching tv shows. Whenever I have free time I like to keep myself busy by working on a side project or hanging
        out with my
        friends.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am also a Raikes School Ambassador, where I Act as a liaison between potential
        students and the Raikes school, as well as give tours and answer any questions they might have. I am also a
        member of the
        Alpha Tau chapter of Beta Theta Pi here at the university. Inside of Beta I am the assistant new member educator
        and the
        technology chair. Being the assistant new member educator entails leading a group of 35 young men and seamlessly
        transitioning them to college life and help them with all issues they run into. As technolofy chair, I am
        responsible
        for assisting every member of the house in connecting to the printer (and fixing it when necessary), connecting
        to the wifi,
        fixing their ethernet ports and connections, and maintaining the Beta website (as well as setting up accounts
        for all new members).

            The payment tracker progressive web app was designed to assist fraternity organizations

            fraternities
            at UNL. This progressive web app solves an issue that I was approached about regarding knowing who has paid
            and making it easier on the social teams to track this as they have alot on their plates. I was constantly
            in contact with the social team members from these two fraternities getting their feedback on all the
            changes I had made, constantly creating new iteration of the app until they were satisfied.

      <p>
        This website was designed to be used by the UNL baseball team. We were approached by the
        baseball coach about a problem he had recording the statistics of his players in practice -- and the players
        were unable to see their performance from practice until the end of the week. This website enables them to see
        their
        stats right after practice, and it makes it easier on the baseball managers to record these stats (as opposed to
        the
        paper and pencil method they were using before).

        I created a portfolio website in order to explain the projects I have worked on in the hopes that employers
        would enjoy their experience interacting with it and give me the opporunity to intern for them. I enjoy
        working on projects like these because it teaches me alot, and I love learning new languages and concepts.
        During this project specifically, I learned alot about UI design and how to get better at HTML and css.

      Throughout this experience, I learned C++, C#, and major problem-solving skills, skills in Visual Studio, and how
      to tackle problems
      I have never seen before. This was a great experience that taught me so many valuable skills and lessons, and I

        I was paired up with two individuals in the Raikes school cohort 2020 (freshmen this year). My job is to help
        them
        seamlessly
        transition into college and the Raikes school, and answer any questions they have about classes, living in
        Kauffman (the Raikes school

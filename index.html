        Hello, my name is Parker Miller. I am originally from Kansas City,
        but now go to school at the University of Nebraska - Lincoln in the Raikes School of Computer Science and
        Business Management. The Raikes school is a highly selective and prestigious school within the honors program at
        the University of Nebraska. The main focus of the Raikes program is the interdisciplinary combination of
        computer science, business, and teamwork. While attending this school and through previous internships, I have
        picked up skills in
        Java, C#,
        C, C++, JavaScript, Python, R, SQL, HTML, CSS, and React.js.
      </p>
      <p style="font-family: Inter;">
        Outside of academics I love playing sports with my friends (specifically lacrosse). I also enjoy playing video
        games and binge
        watching tv shows. Whenever I have free time I like to keep myself busy by working on a side project or hanging
        out with my
        friends.
      </p>
      <p style="font-family: Inter;">
        I am also a Raikes School Ambassador, where I Act as a liaison between potential
        students and the Raikes school, as well as give tours and answer any questions they might have. Outside of
        Raikes, I am a
        member of the
        Alpha Tau chapter of Beta Theta Pi here at the university. Inside of Beta I am the assistant new member educator
        and the
        technology chair. Being the assistant new member educator entails leading a group of 35 young men and seamlessly
        transitioning them to college life and help them with all issues they run into. As technolofy chair, I am
        responsible
        for assisting every member of the house in connecting to the printer (and fixing it when necessary), connecting
        to the wifi,
        fixing their ethernet ports and connections, and maintaining the Beta website (as well as setting up accounts
        for all new members).

            The payment tracker progressive web app was designed to assist fraternity organizations
            in tracking which of their members had paid for a given event. This is currently being used in two
            fraternities
            at UNL. The social team members came to me with an issue they had keeping track of who was attending events
            and who had already paid. I designed this progressive web app in order to make their lives easier and ensure
            they were not miscounting the money they had receieved. I was constantly
            in contact with the social team members from these two fraternities getting their feedback on all the
            changes I had made, constantly creating new iteration of the app until they were satisfied.

            This website was designed to be used by the UNL baseball team. We were approached by the
            baseball coach about a problem he had recording the statistics of his players in practice -- and the players
            were unable to see their performance from practices until the end of each week. This website allows for the
            players to see
            their
            stats right after practice, and it makes it easier on the baseball managers to record these stats (as
            opposed to
            the
            paper and pencil method they were using before). This, in turn, increases the efficiency of practices, lets
            the
            coaches know who has been performing well, and allows for easier and more accurate planning of games based
            on
            who has been the best performing athlete.

        I created this portfolio website in order to explain the projects I have worked on in the hopes that employers
        would enjoy their experience interacting with it and give me the opporunity to intern for them. I enjoy
        working on projects like these because it teaches me alot, and I love learning new languages and concepts.
        During this project specifically, I learned a lot about UI design and increased my skills in HTML and CSS.

      Throughout this experience, I learned C++, C#, major problem-solving skills, skills in Visual Studio, and how
      to tackle problems
      I have never seen before. This was a great experience that taught me so many valuable skills and lessons, and I
      look forward to more
      internships in the tech industry in the future.
